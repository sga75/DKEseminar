Prerequisite: Data Path Configuration

Before running the project, please ensure the DATA_PATH variable in scripts/config.py is updated to the absolute path of your website-data directory. 

For example:

DATA_PATH = "C:\\path\\to\\your\\website-data"

Replace "C:\path\to\your\website-data" with the actual full path where your website-data folder is located on your system.
